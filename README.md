# Tiny GOES Dynamic Wallpaper

I'm using [GOES](https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/GOES/) images to be my wallpaper, such as macOS Mojave's dynamic wallpaper.

The Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite system (GOES), operated by the United States' National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service division, supports weather forecasting, severe storm tracking, and meteorology research[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_Operational_Environmental_Satellite).

## Dependencies

* Python 3.x
* feh

## Usage

To run with default configuration (resolution of 339 pixels) run:

```
$ python3 goes_dynamic_wallpaper
```

You can also inform the resolution and the path you want to store the images.

``` 
$ python3 goes_dynamic_wallpaper -r 1808 -p path_where_to_store_images
```

This script doesn't persist images for too long because they can be huge files(greater than 72MB sometimes).
